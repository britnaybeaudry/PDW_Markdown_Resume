### What is Markdown?
* Markdown is a language that you can use to format text on the web. It's more complicated than a plain .txt document, but less complicated than HTML.
* Markdown can be a great way to visualize some writtgen word on the web. In Markdown you can make the text **bold**, <em>italicized</em>, ***both both AND italicized***, and much more! You can even use emojis :alien: :woman_astronaut: :earth_africa: :artificial_satellite:
* **<em>In fact</em>, this tutorial** is written in Markdown! You can check out what is looks like by going to edit the file (<em>hint: click on the pencil icon up on the right!</em>)
* Getting started <em>with</em> Markdown
  * GitHub has a basic guide to Markdown's syntax [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
  * A more in-depth guide to Markdown, covering topics both basic and extended can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#paragraphs).
  * We'll be using information from both these guides to help build our resume today.

#### Step 1: Making a place on GitHub for your resume
If you're new to GitHub, have no fear! In order to start the process for hosting your resume on here, you need to create a new repository. You can do that by clicking the new button up here at the top of the page, circled in red in the image below. You can also see a step-by-step guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

</p>

From here, you can name your repository. I recommend that you name it something straight to the point, like "resume" or "yourname_resume". That way, it's easier to remember what's in there. Also, make sure that the repository is set to **Public**, so that people can see it!

Create your repository and add a new file. This is where we will create the resume in Markdown. 
<p align="center">

    <img src="./photos/new_repo_file.JPG" width=400 align="center">
  </kbd>
</p>

Next, name the file "README.md" the "README" section makes it so that it shows up automatically when people look at th file here on GitHub. The ".md" section tells GutHub to make this a Markdown file.

Now you have a place to get started on the resume!
